Have been through the most.. but there are some plugins that I could still use.. tag hightlight.
In the vim/plugins there are some links also that could be used.

Telescope
https://github.com/nvim-telescope/telescope.nvim
Note: theprimeagen is giving good review on this.. and is customizing it. Seems like a must.
In the video he also adds the telescope-fzf plugin.. 4 plugings in all. The video:

Youtube notes

ThePrimeagen - VIM Movements P2: 5 moves to make you better ked
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QN4fuSsWTbA
- anbefaler ctrl+[
- f el. t char.. med ; (frem) og , (tilbage)
- c instead of d.. when using cw (instead of ce) the autocomplete window
  will popup. Ex EventType.ScreenTypeChanged..
- c d and v work well together with i and a.
  if (authentication.isAuthenticate()) {
    client.send();
    queue.event();
  }
  vi ( or ) will select between brackets
  va ( or ) will select including brackets
  va { will select the whole if block
  di { will delete inside the if { } block.. but remain in normal mode
  ci { will delete inside the if { } block.. and be in edit mode.. nice!
- mark.. 
- move block.. Shift v (for line).. and then Shift j or k.. it will now
  move the block down or up.. and reformat.
- gv: note that gv rehighligts previous highlight.

# coc.nvim and coc.java
Install npm
Set JAVA_HOME
:CocInstall coc-java
See mappings in vimrc.

# coc-java-debug vimspector
Having problems nvim ie. and sees "sudo npm install neovim".. but current version
of npm can't use the newer version of nodejs.
I then start to update npm:

> sudo apt remove nodejs
> sudo apt install nodejs

By removing the npm the npm of nodejs will be used:
> sudo npm uninstall -g npm
Then get the latest
> npm install -g npm@latest

I then drop installing neovim using npm.. and download the binary as before (see neovim install)

:CocInstall coc-java-debug

Added to .vimrc
let g:vimspector_enable_mappings = 'HUMAN'
nmap <F2> :CocCommand java.debug.vimspector.start<CR>

Then run in nvim:
:VimspectorInstall vscode-java-debug
.. after setting breakpoint works with F9 :-)

Add vimspector.json to the root of project (see coc-java-debug).

Set breakpoint with F9.

Start debugger with remote enabled and wait:
> java -Xdebug -Xrunjdwp:server=y,transport=dt_socket,address=5005,suspend=y Hello

Run debugger with F2 to attach to debugger.

Vimspector error:
For some reason vimspector is not able to find python3.
:checkhealth show that pynvim is not installed.

Solution:
> sudo apt update 
> sudo apt upgrade
> sudo apt install python3-pip
> sudo pip3 install pynvim
